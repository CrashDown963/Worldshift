briefings.12 cities	Presently, humans still free of the Plague’s corruptive touch live in five independent megalopolises: Dunetown, in the desert of Sahaar; Saling, in former China; Varun, in the Indian Ocean; Jurra, in the swampy jungles of former Siberia; and Fort Frost, in the frozen fields of North America.<nl><nl>These megacities are huge towers protected from the Plague and other outside influences by strong xenolite-powered force shields. The humans regularly send small expeditions into the wilderness to mine xenolite and collect other much-needed resources. This often leads to skirmishes with the mutant tribes.	no
briefings.12 denkar	Denkar ni’Varra is the son of the former Governor of Saling, Onkar ni’Varra. As one of the Lord Commanders of Saling, Denkar was responsible for the security of his father’s research expeditions.<nl><nl>After overseeing a disastrous expedition of which Denkar was the sole survivor, and as a result, the Governor by right of succession, he returned to Saling only to discover he could no longer look people in the eyes. No one dared an open accusation, but the word ‘patricide’ hung in the air everywhere.<nl><nl>Guided by his strict military code of honor, Denkar believed that his failure, alongside these suspicions, made him unworthy of ruling the city. He decided to give up the position of Governor to his sister Arna and entered into a self-imposed exile.	no
briefings.12 onkar	Onkar ni’Varra was the Governor of the city of Saling. An enlightened ruler compared to most of his predecessors, he had a passion for ancient history and mutant lore, and often personally took part in exploration expeditions.<nl><nl>Onkar was killed by Varunian troops while investigating ancient ruins near the border which separates the Salingian and Varunian zones of influence. His son, Denkar, also took part in the expedition, and proved to be its only survivor.	no
briefings.12 saling	Saling is one of the five human megacities, located in former China. The Plague has turned the surrounding lands into an ever-burning wasteland.<nl><nl>In Saling culture, the concept of honor plays a very important role, both in military and civic matters.<nl><nl>The city’s nobility add the prefix "ni" to their family names. Currently, the city’s Governorship belongs to the ni’Varra family.	no
briefings.12 tamani	Tamani is a mutant settlement located alongside other villages in a sprawling oasis in Sahaar.<nl><nl>No one but Denkar knows how he had survived for several years in the wastelands or where his travels had taken him, but he had recently settled in Tamani and soon had a budding relationship with a local mutant girl.<nl><nl>As Denkar regularly went on exploration trips through Sahaar, he was absent when Dunetown forces laid siege to Tamani.	no
briefings.12	Having failed to save Onkar’s life, rumors spread that Denkar had committed patricide! Deciding that his future as Governor would be untenable, Denkar passed Governorship to his sister Arna and left Saling.<nl><nl>A couple years later, he found a large oasis in the Sahaar desert and used Tamani, a village there, as a base camp for exploration.<nl><nl>Returning from one of his trips, Denkar finds Tamani under attack by Dunetown troops. They have blocked the path to the village and so he must rally for help and fight his way through...	yes
briefings.13 eji	Eji is a mutant girl living in the village of Wakono. Her parents are unknown; Ganthu discovered her in the jungle as a child and was amazed that she had been able to survive alone among the creatures of the Plague. Later, it became apparent that Eji has remarkably strong psi talents for healing and empathy. Ganthu took her under his protection, and while watching her grow, he gradually became convinced that she is the Redeemer spoken of in ancient prophecy.	no
briefings.13 ganthu	Ganthu is the High Priest of the village of Wakono, well versed in the art of the mutants’ magic. He takes a special interest in collecting lore about the ancient past of the world. Some members of the Wakono tribe think that he spends too much time traveling and deciphering the inscriptions found in the ancient ruins and too little in solving the everyday problems of his tribe.	no
briefings.13 ragho	Ragho is one of Wakono shamans, adept with magic but hot-tempered and self-confident. He has been particularly vocal in his reproaches against Ganthu and has often argued with the High Priest. On several occasions, he has gone so far as to openly state that he would make a better leader than Ganthu.	no
briefings.13	After repelling the Dunetowners from Tamani, Denkar and some Tamani warriors hurried to Wakono, a nearby village, to warn them of attack, but before they had even left Tamani, Wakono’s xenolite-rich suburbs were already under fire.<nl><nl>The High Priest of Wakono, Ganthu, tries to defend his village, but Ragho has sent many warriors away on a ‘scouting’ mission. Ganthu must protect Eji, his apprentice. Her safety is of the utmost importance as Ganthu believes her to be the ‘Redeemer’ mentioned in an ancient prophecy.	yes
briefings.14 allies	Both Ganthu and Denkar were quite surprised when they met each other, as one is a human Lord Commander which has lived in a mutant village and fought at the side of the Tribes, and the other a High Priest that had recently abandoned both his tribe and his position as leader. The conversation that followed, though, proved to be even more surprising.<nl><nl>Ganthu was fascinated to learn that Denkar’s father had been researching the ancient legends, and that Denkar himself also seemed to take interest in the topic. Maybe it was the knowledge gained by Denkar during his travels, or his longing to see his home and sister once again -- and perhaps Eji’s psychic presence helped a little -- but in the end, Denkar decided to help Ganthu in his quest to guide the Redeemer to her destiny. As a first step on their journey, they decided to travel to Saling and check Onkar’s library for anything connected to the Redeemer prophecy.	no
briefings.14 ming_base	It seems that a Lord Commander from Dunetown maintains a large mining operation in the desert near the oasis. His base is behind the raids on the Tribes settlements. It is highly unusual for a human mining expedition to maintain facilities of such size, especially for protracted periods of time.<nl><nl>The scouts of the Tribes have reported that there is a personnel carrier in the mining camp that seems to be flight-ready at all times. Denkar, Ganthu, and Eji can steal it to fly to Saling.	no
briefings.14	Denkar and the warriors came across Ganthu and Eji outside Wakono and learned they were too late. Considering their options, they all decided to travel to Saling together in search of knowledge within Onkar’s archives. The Tamani warriors wanted retribution against the Dunetowners who had attacked their villages and after some reconnaissance it was clear that both goals could be achieved.<nl><nl>The plan: Infiltrate the Dunetown base in the desert with some Tribal troops, teach the Lord Commander a lesson for harassing the local villages, steal an aircraft and reach Saling... Simple!	yes
briefings.15	Flying a Dunetown aircraft close to Saling is never a wise idea, so Denkar, knowing its defenses, faced a difficult choice: to either risk being shot down by his own people or to brave the lava fields surrounding the city by foot.<nl><nl>Choosing to land outside the city he must now brave crossing the lava fields to reach Saling’s closest outpost!	yes
briefings.16 mutants	Mutants are not tolerated at all in the human cities; even humans born within the city’s walls are euthanized if they are discovered to have mutations. While mutants from the Tribes may approach the city and enter under the shield which surrounds it, they are not allowed in the city tower itself.<nl><nl>As a member of the ruling family, Denkar would once have been able to ensure access for his companions; however, as he is now unwelcome in Saling, a way must be found for Ganthu and Eji to slip in without unwanted witnesses.	no
briefings.16	Denkar became even more determined to enter Saling and meet Arna, his sister. He has learned that Joss ni’Marten, a long standing political rival to the ni’Varra family, has made him persona non grata.  Denkar worries that his sister has lost control of Saling!<nl><nl>Now Denkar, Ganthu, and Eji must infiltrate Saling to meet Arna. Since mutants are absolutely unwelcome in the city tower, Denkar plans to divert the guards and gain access through a service entrance hidden by rocks near the city.	yes
briefings.21 aliens	While Denkar, Ganthu, and Eji were talking to the Council of the Order, unknown troops simultaneously attacked many installations in the outskirts of Aurora. The attackers were definitely non-human and didn’t look like ordinary mutants or Plague spawn. Some of them were vaguely humanoid and seemed to lead the others; there were also what seemed to be regular soldiers from several different species, half living creatures and half machines.<nl><nl>The councilors told Denkar that similar creatures had already been encountered several times during recent expeditions, though their origin and purposes were still unclear.	no
briefings.21 arna	Denkar’s sister, Arna ni’Varra, officially became the Governor of Saling when her brother left the city. Her rule did not last, however, as the ni’Martens, a rival family, quietly managed to take over shortly thereafter. Through bribery, blackmail, and a series of well-orchestrated ‘accidents’, they stripped Arna of her loyal guards, advisors, and assistants. Arna tried to resist but there was little she could do alone. The ni’Martens began to dictate her actions. When she stated that she would no longer cooperate, she ended up locked in her own mansion and drugged, only to be shown briefly on television for official occasions.<nl><nl>Thus, when Denkar was arrested, Arna was unable to provide any help; quite the contrary, she seemed to be in dire need of help herself.	no
briefings.21 aurora	Aurora is a new megacity secretly built by humans and mutants together under the guidance of the Order. It is located on the continent of New Hope. The city is not yet finished but it is already inhabited. This city features not only the shield against the Plague similar to those of the other five cities, but it also has another, secondary shield designed to hide it from prying eyes. Because mutants do not like living in a huge concrete tower, they have set up settlements around the city.<nl><nl>Kuna transported Denkar, Arna, Ganthu, and Eji to Aurora after she freed them from the Governor’s mansion in Saling.	no
briefings.21 denkar	The Order had been tracking the military career of Denkar ni’Varra in Saling, so the councilors knew him to be a capable commander. When the alien attack began, they promptly appointed him as a Lord Commander of Aurora and sent him to defend a scientific installation in the outskirts of the city. Still confused and unsure what to think of his miraculous escape from Saling, Denkar soon found himself against a completely unknown enemy.	no
briefings.21 kuna	Judge Kuna ni’Dahl is a secret member of an organization called ‘the Order’. After she reported the circumstances around Denkar’s arrest to the Order, she received instructions to extract him along with his sister and the mutants, with the intent of bringing them to safety in the secret city of Aurora. Kuna incapacitated the room’s guards and used a special techno-magical device to teleport herself and the liberated prisoners to Aurora.	no
briefings.21 order	The Order is a secret organization spanning all five human cities. Its members believe that the future of both humans and mutants depends on the ability of the two factions to live and work together. The Order recruits its members carefully and secretly, picking individuals with suitable mindsets. The Order also offers refuge for humans with hidden mutations, like psychic abilities, that have not been discovered after birth, seeing them as a product of evolution and not as a threat.<nl><nl>The first fruits of the joint human-mutant efforts are already at hand: new technologies have been developed combining traditional technology with magic, and an entire new city is being built on the continent of New Hope.	no
briefings.21	Denkar, Ganthu and Eji managed to reach the top of the city tower, but they did not go unnoticed! As they entered Arna’s mansion they found Joss ni’Marten surrounded by his troopers, holding a gun to Arna’s head. Denkar had to surrender.<nl><nl>Joss ni’Marten locked Arna and the new captives in the mansion. The situation seemed hopeless, but not for long! Judge Kuna ni’Dahl, appointed to guard the mansion, suddenly incapacitated the room guards and using a strange device, transported herself and the prisoners to the secret city of Aurora – Headquarters of the Order.<nl><nl>While Denkar’s small party was being presented to the authorities, unknown attackers were threatening Aurora. The councilors of the Order sent Denkar to help the defenders.	yes
briefings.22 diary	Onkar ni’Varra’s diary contains data that he collected throughout his archaeological expeditions, information touching upon human and mutant legends and other bits of information about the ancient times. In conjunction with the knowledge collected by the Order, the diary may reveal clues about the possible whereabouts of the Lost City. But now the diary lies somewhere in the jungle, at the fateful place where Onkar was ambushed by the Varunians.	no
briefings.22 lost_city	The Lost City of the humans is an ancient myth. Few know about the legend, even fewer believe in it, and no one knows where it is located. As the tale goes, this city had been built by mutants and humans together and flourished for many years until one day it inexplicably disappeared.<nl><nl>It seems that the Order takes this legend rather seriously, and the Council believes that the legacy of the Lost City contains a secret that may yet change the future of humans and mutants alike: a weapon against the Plague.	no
briefings.22 meeting	The councilors revealed to Denkar and his companions that the Order was searching for the mythical lost city of the humans, the predecessor of the current five megalopolises. According to the legends and the scarce archaeological finds, it was built by the ancient humans and mutants centuries ago, and held secrets that might change the future of both races.<nl><nl>Seeing this mission as a continuation of their father’s work, Denkar and Arna decided to do their best to help the Order. Ganthu also saw a connection between the tales of the lost city and the prophecy about the Redeemer and offered his help as well, much to the excitement of Eji, who perceived the entire affair as a thrilling adventure.	no
briefings.22	Back in the city, as Denkar fought off the alien attack, Eji used her healing powers to cleanse Arna from the effects of ni’Marten’s drugs. Later, Ganthu, Eji, and the ni’Varra siblings were called again before the Council to learn that the Order had been searching for the secrets of a mythical Lost City. Denkar and Arna decided to help them, as did Ganthu who felt this quest somehow connected with the Redeemer’s destiny.<nl><nl>With the ni’Varra’s family library out of reach, the only way to retrieve Onkar’s research data was to get his field diary, which he carried when he met his death. This task brings mixed feelings to Denkar’s heart.	yes
briefings.23 diary	Denkar retrieved his father’s diary and brought it back just to find that it was encrypted. Luckily, it turned out that Arna had the key because she had occasionally helped Onkar with his analyses. However, the numerous data fragments and inscriptions documented in the diary remained cryptic, even after being deciphered.<nl><nl>After comparing Onkar’s data with the Order’s archives, a location in Inca was deemed a suitable target to search. Supposedly, a human outpost had existed there in the times of the Lost City’s apogee.	no
briefings.23	By combining entries to Onkar’s diary with data from the Order’s archives it became apparent that an outpost of the Lost City once existed in Inca. Denkar flies there with a detachment of the Order’s forces and a small science team. However, nothing is as easy as it sounds and several minutes before they arrive the aircraft’s sensors  pick up unusual movement and energy at the site... it’s far from desolate!	yes
briefings.24	During their search, Denkar and his companions visited many locations discovering scattered bits of knowledge, including the name of the lost city itself: Esperanza. The location of the city however remained a mystery.<nl><nl>The party’s quest has now led them to a frozen wasteland in America, where a large Esperantian outpost once existed. If the team have their facts right, below them may be a well preserved underground complex! 	yes
briefings.25 final_clue	After entering the tunnels of the ancient outpost, Denkar and his companions quickly reached a dead end, a spacious junction with many collapsed entrances. A huge relief map of the world adorned the wall, its golden plating still gleaming undernearth the layers of dust. Bases and outposts were scattered across its gilded continents, all connected to a single, sun-like golden hub. Even without the inscription, its meaning was obvious. It was the heart of the society whose artists had created this map: Esperanza!	no
briefings.25	According to ancient records, many tried to reach Esperanza after its fall, but none had returned to tell the tale. Surprising then that the city, inexorably fallen into oblivion, had faded into an obscure legend.<nl><nl>The Council have decided to proceed carefully, sending only a small force to Esperanza’s newly discovered location. Denkar’s party make their way through the suburbs of the ancient city and gain access to the remains of its main tower.	yes
briefings.26	Denkar and his companions have entered Esperanza and, for now at least, have left their alien pursuers behind. Continuing to sense a strengthening telepathic signal, Eji can give directions to the party.<nl><nl>It is still unclear however what the aliens are doing around Esperanza, but it looks like they’re up to no good! Denkar, Ganthu and Eji must find their way through the ancient city to reach the source of the signal.	yes
briefings.31 aliens	Jaar Lash is a powerful alien species that has colonized many star systems and subjugated their populations, turning them into cyborg workers, servants, and soldiers.<nl><nl>For many long years, Jaar Lash have been fighting a great war among the stars against an even stronger adversary, and they felt that they were gradually losing.<nl><nl>During the war, a faction of Jaar Lash which vaguely resembled the knight orders of the ancient Earth became disgraced and outcast. They had been defeated in a key battle, and their failure led to the destruction of an entire star system.<nl><nl>This Cult now seeks redemption by trying to aid their species in their own way: searching for Seeds and using them to launch cosmic-scale attacks upon the home planets of Jaar Lash’s enemy.	no
briefings.31 resonator	The psi resonator is an ancient Esperantian device jointly created by humans and mutants. Its original purpose was to allow a powerful psychic to connect with the Shard and try to slow its development as well as the spreading of the Plague. The Esperantians succeeded in their goal, but then something went very, very wrong. It is unknown what exactly was attempted, but it caused a terrible backlash, triggering a massive eruption of the Plague, which overwhelmed the city’s defenses and reduced it to ruins.<nl><nl>Powered by the pinnacle of human technology and mutant magic, the psi resonator continued working silently for centuries, keeping the Shard somewhat dormant and ultimately preventing the Jaar Lash from performing the Acceleration.	no
briefings.31 sacrifice	"Watch out! I sense many enemies approaching," Eji shouted, only moments before all hell broke loose. Alien soldiers soon erupted from all corners, spitting burning plasma. A towering alien leader emerged from the shadows, casting Denkar aside with a mighty blow, and prepared to finish him.<nl><nl>Time stood still for a heartbeat as the end seemed moments away. Amidst the chaos, Eji’s gaze fell on Ganthu. Her mentor was kneeling, his palms on his temples, obviously under great pressure. His body then collapsed, and seconds later, the tall alien turned to Eji and Ganthu’s voice rang throughout her head. "It’s alright, I got him. His forces won’t attack you. But I’m afraid I lost myself."	no
briefings.31 seeds	As Ganthu has learned from Tharksh’s knowledge, the Seeds are fragments of a living world. They fly through space in search of suitable planets, consume them, and convert them into their own kind. In the end, the mature organism splits into new Seeds.<nl><nl>Through a procedure or ritual called ‘Acceleration’, the entirety of a Seed’s energy may be channelled towards a chosen target, forming a shock wave that is capable of obliterating an entire planet. In the process, the Seed’s host planet will be devastated and quite possibly destroyed.<nl><nl>After locating a Seed on Earth, Jaar Lash tried to perform the ritual but found that some unknown force prevented it from activating. Their plans were further complicated by the existence of a local sentient population, something very rarely seen on a world that has been infected by a Seed for any length of time.	no
briefings.31 tharksh	Master Tharksh is a high ranking member of the Cult, answering only to the Archmaster himself. As one of the several Masters entrusted to secure and destroy the psi resonator, he almost succeeded in his task.<nl><nl>The High Priest Ganthu has since implanted his mind in Tharksh’s body but will not be able to hold him under control for very long. Nevertheless, Tharksh’s minions are now Ganthu’s to command, and he will use them to aid Denkar.	no
briefings.31	Just as the party reached the ancient device, they were attacked by aliens from all sides. Their leader was about to kill Denkar when Ganthu intervened, sacrificing his own body to gain control over the alien's mind and unveil his origins and purpose.<nl><nl>The aliens had been wanting to use the Shard as a weapon against a powerful enemy, but in the process, the Shard would consume its host planet! The Esperantian device was interfering with their plan.<nl><nl>With the way back blocked by more Jaar Lash forces and Ganthu’s weakening spirit locked in Master Tharksh’s body, the only solution now seems to be to get the artifact on Tharksh’s ship, fly to the Shard and prevent Jaar Lash from performing the ritual.	yes
briefings.32 aa	The Cult has set up an anti-aircraft facility in this area, capable of disabling the flight control systems of any airborne vehicle from a distance. Taken by surprise and with his reactions slowed down by Ganthu’s control, Tharksh barely managed to land the ship without smashing it into the ground. The party has no means to perform the necessary repairs and get the machine back into the air.<nl><nl>Of course, the Jaar Lash has immediately sent patrols towards the crash site.	no
briefings.32	Under Ganthu’s control, Tharksh flew his ship towards the Shard, but a Jaar Lash anti-air facility detected and disabled it above East Siberia. The Cult’s forces immediately approached the crash site.<nl><nl>Now Denkar, Eji, and Ganthu, who is still in control of Tharksh, must use Tharksh’s troops for defense and find another way to get the psi resonator to the Shard.	yes
briefings.33 help	After Denkar had contacted Aurora, the Council decided that, in spite of the compromised cover, the operation should continue while attempting to be as low-profile as possible. Concentrating a large force around the psi resonator would just make it more visible to the Jaar Lash. Judge Kuna ni’Dahl, recently promoted to Commander, immediately commandeered a shuttle and flew to Denkar’s location, accompanied by a small squad of Auroran troops and Arna ni’Varra.	no
briefings.33	After securing the area around Tharksh’s ship, Denkar finally managed to contact Aurora again and explain the situation. Kuna ni’Dahl volunteered immediately to be sent to his aid; Arna embarking with her.<nl><nl>Having been warned about the Jaar Lash’s anti-aircraft installation, Kuna flew low, getting very close to the alien base. When the shuttle’s controls started failing, Kuna reacted swiftly, managing to land the craft without damage.<nl><nl>Now her rescue party has to knock out the alien facility to enable flight in the area again.	yes
briefings.34 jurra	Jurra is one of the few remaining human cities, and is located in North Siberia.<nl><nl>A Jurran expedition detected the downing of the alien ship from a distance, and some of its expeditionary citizens had already met the Jaar Lash in the field; the Jurran commander, being an enterprising fellow, immediately considered that the ship may contain valuable technologies and other items worth plundering. He sent forces to eliminate the supposedly hostile aliens and to secure the area.<nl><nl>Meanwhile, the local mutants, already fed up with the Jurran expeditions in their lands, needed very few additional reasons to grab weapons of their own.	no
briefings.34	The humans from Jurra detected the crash landing of Tharksh’s ship and sent an expedition from their nearest outpost to eliminate the aliens and plunder the ship. Of course, the local Tribes like neither the presence of aliens nor the Jurran activity.<nl><nl>Explaining the situation to the Jurrans doesn’t seem an option, and neither does convincing the local mutants that this particular group of Jaar Lash is escorting the saviors of Earth. Denkar and Tharksh it seems will now have to fight their way through.	yes
briefings.35 hole	A scorched and twisted wasteland, the Hell Hole is where the Shard landed on Earth at the end of the 21st century; not coincidentally, it is also the place where the Plague first began to spread.<nl><nl>The Hell Hole is now controlled by the Cult. To protect their bases and the Shard itself, the Jaar Lash have erected a huge dome-like shield around it. Only their military units are capable of passing through the shield, and so Ganthu/Tharksh must enter alone and find a way to allow passage to his companions.	no
briefings.35	Instead of destroying the psi resonator, as initially intended, Jaar Lash found it a powerful boost to their own plan, so its loss seemed the final blow. Denkar however, refused to accept this as the end of the road and Eji couldn’t stand the thought that Ganthu had made an irreversible sacrifice in vain and so, upon meeting the rescue party, their resolve was firmer than ever.<nl><nl>Resuming their interrupted flight, the party at last approached the Hell Hole with Kuna doing her best to land the shuttle as close to the Shard as possible. Now one last obstacle remains: the shield that Jaar Lash have raised around the heart of the Plague.	yes
briefings.36 acceleration	The psi resonator is installed near the Shard, while the Jaar Lash psychic is in position to complete the Acceleration ritual. The presence of the ancient device will allow him to unleash an even more devastating attack, destroying both the target planet and Earth with unquestionable certainty and ultimate finality.<nl><nl>Eji must use her telepathic connection to the psi resonator to negate the will of the alien psychic and ensure that the Shard will be deactivated instead of awakened. The Jaar Lash’s forces will do their best to eliminate her, meaning that she needs all the protection she can get.	no
briefings.36	Rock after rock, chasm after chasm, sneaking and running, the escort of the Redeemer finally reached the vicinity of the psi resonator. Now the fate of Earth lies in the hands of a fragile mutant girl.<nl><nl>The Jaar Lash psychic is already in position, ready to complete the Acceleration and Denkar, Arna, Kuna and Tharksh must do everything possible and beyond so as to get Eji close enough to the psi resonator and then protect her as she fights her own battle against two alien minds: Jaar Lash and the Shard!	yes
