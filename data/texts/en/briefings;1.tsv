briefings.dtb	As Denkar and Ganthu noted, human mining expeditions rarely reached the scale of the Dunetowners’ establishment in the desert of Sahaar.

Stein up to? Infiltrate his main base and find out.
briefings.safari	Plagued lands are full of danger.

Welcome to a safari where the hunter can become prey in an instant!
briefings.kharum	Living in the desert is no piece of cake, particularly when your village is surrounded by monsters and brigands’ camps, but when a huge insane robot settles in a nearby derelict fortification and its minions try to claim the oasis, your trouble is in a new league!<nl><nl>Help the village of Kharum, earn the gratitude of the locals and gain fine reward..
briefings.cf	Magic is always a double-edged weapon – as is ‘summoning magic’. A user of ‘summoning magic’ risks being consumed by the very creatures he seeks to command!

briefings.esperanza	Humans have coveted immortality for millennia to no avail. For all that time, being mentioned in the history books was the closest thing to living forever one could achieve, but it seems at least one person has reached the next step. <nl><nl>After the fall of Esperanza, an Esperantian scientist was isolated in his research station.
