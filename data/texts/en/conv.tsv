13.take me there	Hurry, let’s go!
	
13.last of them	It appears that this was the last of them for now. We should try to drive them away! Hmm... their camp must be fortified.
	
13.diversion	Master Ganthu, it seems the rear of their camp is not defended. Maybe a skillful magic user can sneak in and create a diversion.
13.i will go	All right, I’ll go and try to confuse them.
	
13.kill him	This is him!
13.die freak	Die, mutant trash!
13.trap	Ragho! How could you stoop to treachery! Is ambition to be a chief more important than the tribe’s safety?
13.me traitor	We needed a crisis. It’s high time everybody sees  that we need a strong, decisive leader... not an old bookworm!
13.village endangered	The village could be in danger. Ragho may have been blinded, but I doubt the humans will hold to whatever agreement they made.
	
13.you die eji sold	Hurry as much as you want! You’re not going to make it!  Your precious brat will be the humans’ toy!
13.not eji	Leave Eji out of this!

13.not again	Not again...
	
13.just die	Come out and fight, ‘chief’!

13.yes master	I’m ready, master Ganthu!
	
13.give child	Stop! You leaving alive is not in the plan, Ganthu. I promised the brat to humans.
13.what	What!?
13.never	Harm Eji? Over my corpse, turncoat!!
	
13.enough teleporting	So much for the new chief! We have no place in the village now. That is for certain.
	
13.what now	And now, master Ganthu?
13.journey	Eji, it’s time for us to begin your journey, it seems.
	
//// Mission 1.4	
	
14.need diversion	The way into the camp is shut. We have to get the Dunetowners to open the gate!

14.passage	I see a passage to the north. Maybe we can take a detour through there.
	
14.unlocking	This console has little security. I’ll disable it now.
	
14.can open but beams	These are the controls for the northern gate! I can open it but we’ll need to go around the entire base to use the entrance.
	
14.can open no beams	These control the northern gate! I can open it.
	
14.opening	Done!
	
14.base found	Check out these defenses... No way we are getting in there. Retribution will have to wait.
14.come get some	The outer perimeter has been breached! Intruders are in the camp!

15.passage	I see a passage to the right, just in front of the camp!
	
15.past saling base	Great... Now we must find another way to approach Saling.
	
15.message	Lord ni’Varra, I bring word from our Lord Commander.
15.no chance	Denkar, Senator ni’Marten ordered me to stop you. I cannot disobey.
15.offer	You know you stand no chance alone against my troops, but I offer you a fight of honor. Your versus my squad, outside the camp.
15.trap	It could be a trap!
15.men of honor	I don’t think so. We Salingians are men of honor.

15.respect honor	Honor demands respect as well, Ganthu.
	
	
//// Mission 1.6	
	
16.alarms 1	This is the place. Remember: Don’t let any guard activate the alarm or the whole damn base will be onto us!
16.alarms 2	The Rippers aren’t smart enough but any trooper will try to start the alarm as soon as he identifies an intruder.
16.crowd control	Understood. So if we meet a patrol, we either freeze or confuse the troopers and then finish them off before they run for the alarm.
16.lets go	OK, let’s go.
	
16.got key	This is a key card. It opens the gate.
	
16.can sneak	OK, we are in. If I keep my helmet on and don’t get too close, I think I can walk around freely but the guards better not see Eji and you.
16.not too close	All right, we’ll stay low and count on you to divert their attention.
	
16.guards east	Master Ganthu, I sense many guards to the east of the entrance.
16.cant pass	I see. Denkar, it may be wise for Eji and I to avoid the eastern passage.
	
16.kill guards	I think we can neutralize this patrol. Denkar, go for the Trooper!
	
16.too many	There are too many troopers here, I don’t think even you could sneak through them, Denkar.
16.diversion east	Wait here, I’m gonna try the eastern passage. Maybe I can distract them!
16.careful-16	Be careful!
	
16.found bombs	Hmm... xenolite storage facility! Wonder if they’ve got some of those mining explosives... Gotta watch out these guards aren’t around as I check the crates.
	
16.got bombs	Perfect! I can plant these on a suitable building and detonate them from a distance. It should make the guards go check it out!

23.need time	We’ll need some time to examine this.
23.hurry-23	Quickly! We are sitting ducks.

23.find power	Let’s get moving then. We are looking for something resembling a power source.
	
23.start generator	This may be some kind of a power generator. It seems intact. Let’s try to activate it.
23.expect trouble	But be on your guard! There’s no way those machines are gonna leave us in peace.

23.go back	Let’s get back to the first site and see if we can get something from the computers!

24.thanks for reinforcements	Thank you!
	
24.priest dead	Their High Priest is dead... let’s go before they blame us!
	
24.giant spider	The entrance to the underground complex is behind the monster. We have to kill it to get in!

25.protect gates	We gotta protect the gate, they’ll try and get in for sure!
	
25.no more aliens	Hmm, it seems they decided to leave us alone for now.
25.strange	Something is not right with this calm. They may have adjusted their plans around our presence.
25.faint song	Wait... I’m sensing something coming from the entrance... like a faint song in my mind.
25.prophecy	Could it be the song from the prophesy? Can you follow it?
25.can follow	I think so.
25.enter	Then let’s go in and get to the bottom of this.

26.second trap	A second trap! Le’s be more careful.
26.why traps	Who would set traps in a ruin?
26.guess about traps	Wait a minute! Maybe they’re not traps but just malfunctioning machines. Who knows what magic and technology was used here.
	
26.third trap	Here it goes again!
26.spot traps	Maybe there is a way to see these things in advance.
26.activate traps	I have the strongest armor, I’ll take lead and activate ’em ahead of us.

//// Mission 3.5	
	
35.is it a teleporter	The Jaar Lash came right out of this thing. Is it a teleporter?
35.disable spawner 1	Yes. Tharksh can disable it to prevent more reinforcements from coming.
35.can we use it	Can’t we use it to get somewhere?
35.receiver only	It is only a receiver. Besides, it would guide us exactly to where the reinforcements are coming from.
	
35.spawner 1 disabled	Tharksh is ready.
	
35.disable spawner 2	Another teleporter. I think we hit their first line of defense.
	
35.spawner 2 disabled	No more aliens now!
	
35.disable spawner 3	Another one! We can’t let them delay us.
35.cant leave them	We can’t leave these creatures spawning behind us.
	
35.spawner 3 disabled	The receiver is disabled.

35.this is the last	This may be the last one. It seems we’ve reached some kind of checkpoint.
	
35.describe situation	There is a teleportation pad here but the controls are somewhere behind the shield, that only Jaar Lash can pass through.
35.we have a plan	Our only option: Tharksh enter, find the controls and teleport us inside.
35.jaar lash units	Tharksh can take Jaar Lash units with him.
35.we wait-35	OK then, the rest of us will have to wait here.
35.dont like	I don’t like the idea of splitting our forces right now.
35.no choice	We have no choice.
	
35.teleporter controls	Tharksh thinks these are the controls for the teleporter. He must activate it while he is still alive!
	
35.disable spawner 5	We shouldn’t leave an enabled teleporter behind us!
35.fast enough	Tharksh will disable the teleporter fast enough.
	
35.dead end	A dead end!
35.enable teleporter	There is a teleporter here but we must eliminate the defenses to reach the control device.
	
35.spawner 5 disabled	This receiver is disabled.
35.hurry-35	We also shouldn’t waste time.
35.done	OK, let’s move on.
	
	
//// Mission 3.6	
	
36.do you sense	Eji, is this the right direction? Do you sense the Psi Resonator?
36.too far	Yes, the direction is right. I hear the song faintly but I’m too far to connect to the machine.
36.find spot	Then move on until we’re close enough.
	
36.found spot	I think I’m close enough. The alien is already singing to the Shard! We must hurry!
36.get him	This battle is yours only, Eji. We can’t help you fight it but we will protect you with our lives.
36.concentration	His mind is... very strong. I’ll need full concentration.
36.guard eji	It seems the link to the Resonator physically protects Eji. Nevertheless, we should guard her from attacks or she will lose concentration.
36.attack alien	It may also be a good idea to find and attack their psychic to disrupt <i>his</> concentration.
	
36.it is done	It is done.
36.shard changing	Look! The Shard is changing!
	
36.too strong	He’s too strong... Can’t... hold... him...
