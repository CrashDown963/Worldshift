intro_line_1	00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:06,246	Eji, what’s troubling you tonight?
intro_line_2	00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:09,243	I heard Ragho quarreling with you today.
intro_line_3	00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:12,433	Hmm, yes. He does not lack ambition.
intro_line_4	00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,033	He may indeed take my place one day,
intro_line_5	00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:19,513	but to be a good leader he must<nl>learn to control his aggression…
intro_line_6	00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,260	Lord ni’Varra’s coming!
intro_line_7	00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:45,816	Father, are you sure you don’t need more guards?
intro_line_8	00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:48,726	We seek ancient knowledge, Arna, not battle.
intro_line_9	00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:52,381	Your brother’s troops are the finest soldiers in Saling.
intro_line_10	00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,113	You two take care.
intro_line_11	00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:05,388	Oh, my child, you never cease to amaze me.
intro_line_12	00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:07,417	But, Ganthu, it’s just a flower.
intro_line_13	00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:12,564	Flower or not, defying death is a miracle,
intro_line_14	00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:17,705	but don’t forget – even the<nl>smallest actions have their price.
intro_line_15	00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,873	Sir, your father’s coming.
intro_line_16	00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:23,502	Report, Commander.
intro_line_17	00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,462	Almost ready, sir!
intro_line_18	00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:35,969	My child, one day you will fulfill your destiny<nl>and I will be there to help you.
intro_line_19	00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:40,210	Ganthu, sometimes I try to<nl>picture myself in a prophecy but…
intro_line_20	00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,382	can one person be that important?
intro_line_21	00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,318	‘All is one’, as they say.
intro_line_22	00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,889	Perhaps you’re playing a role in a<nl>great story that started long ago
intro_line_23	00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:53,167	or even one that’s just about to begin…
